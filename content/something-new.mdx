I have very unsteady hands, THUS, poor handwriting and drawing ability in general, THUS, why I try to make simple and easy to reproduce things, like in this very miscellaneous work in progress. I'm honestly just cheesing this look by using the caligraphy pen and MANY redos. I have no idea if the "dots and thin lines thing" in this is a good idea, but I ended up doing it in something else I was drawing and liked it a lot, so I wanted to expand on it and include it in a script somehow.

### Top

Like I've mentioned before in a previous post, the characters of the script right now are in no particular alphabetical order or applying to any sounds. I just like to draw things out first and attempt to apply meaning to them later. Obviously it's not as impressive, I need to learn more.

### Bottom

Me being very indecisive, I've laid some characters out in several styles trying to see which looks best. I didn't have any reason or motivation for picking one particular style before I started, it really could end up being any one of them. The rotation in the second horizontal and vertical versions is just because I think some, or maybe all, of the characters could look better turned at some angle (tbh, rotation is kind of a cheat code if you don't have a strict vision).

#### PAY NO ATTENTION TO "lankind" not being "mankind"!

I simplified the characters and made them less busy by removing a lot of the extra dotted lines, per the advice of [u/sumuissa](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/12pdpky/comment/jgmr039/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). It's probably a step in the right direction, but I wanted to keep at least one in each of them because that was the original idea.

Rotation: cheat code or crutch? I rotated all the characters 90deg to go with the horizontally aligned thing mentioned in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/12pdpky/first_draft_of_something_new_some_minor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), and it probably makes most of them look better than how I first drew them... I think this "style" works best, especially for the vertical (apparently right-to-left also) version in the second image.

The key in the third image, as mentioned in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/12pdpky/first_draft_of_something_new_some_minor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), is still temporary. I only slapped English on it, minus X and Z because I noticed I was two characters short, so I could mock up these lines from my favorite movies. Which unless you take two seconds looking at the key will remain a secret.

Maybe a style that could emerge from this is when words are put together, their bottom curved lines could merge and be a uniform straight line, like in styles of Arabic? idk.
