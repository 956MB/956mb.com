### Context

Just messing around with various styles that came to mind with this script. ('Serif thingies', lines instead of circles, and different alignment). I want to point out I STILL feel like I have no idea what I'm doing! :)

1. 'Serifs': I guess you'd call these serifs, these were just to try and spice things up a little, maybe they'd make it look a bit more complicated than it really is. I don't know if they're necessary though.
2. Without the circles, the script became a lot less busy looking when lines of text were typed out. I think it starts to look 'a lot more like other languages/scripts' though with the center line instead of the circles, but going in this direction with it I think it looks better. Definitely looks less like fish hooks, glasses or little stick figures.
3. Going back to the original and more normal alignment, [mentioned in my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/1281xvo/i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing/), I think it starts to look better still. Maybe it looks even more like other languages or scripts, but it takes up much less vertical space. Which makes it more 'practical' or easier to make a font out of, IMO.
