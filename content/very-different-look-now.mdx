### Note

This is just one particular style I've gone down a rabbit hole on. The original caligraphy looking style would probably look better if I had the skills to pentool that out and refine it, this look was much simpler though.

### Dots

Do the dots on some of them meaning anything? What's that from? : They mean nothing and they might as well be gone. They're from a design detail seen in my [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/12pdpky/first_draft_of_something_new_some_minor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/12rpf49/lines_from_my_three_favorite_movies/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) post, where some instead of the normal horizontal line had a horizontal line with a dot on one end. Just some random design detail I thought was neat and made it JUST different enough. The few dots in there may stay because I think it adds just a little something, and theres a bit of variation that happens when the dot is moved to say the middle or bottom of the character if the spacing requires it. Like with 'dr' the dot is at the bottom, but if it were 'cr' the dot could stay at the top.

### Japanese

Obvious Hiragana/Katakana vibes have emerged in some of these. Not intentional, but I guess that just happens subconsciously since I love the language so much. Also the fact I'm using as simple lines as possible because of my inability to draw complex shapes :(

### EE FF OO LL SS TT

Sticking with the oringal shapes very closely, some of the double letter combinations just don't look that great, IMO. So I thougt it'd be neat if some of these had special glyphs, or I guess technically ligatures, for doubles. This may be a completely incorrect way of doing this in a script, but I think it's cool. Helps the 'flow' of a word a bit, at least in some cases.
