### Goals & Influences

1. I noticed the way [u/Yello116](https://www.reddit.com/user/Yello116/) drew his [AMAZING abugida 'A Θiōli, a language in the Tirōlî family tree.'](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/13h2uqk/just_spent_the_last_6_hours_fleshing_out_this/)inside the 2x2 grid making each character very even. I wanted to try this because it seemed like a great restriction to put on yourself to get a different outcome than normal. Of course mine isn't nearly as good.
2. Each line in the characters must start, end or intersect through one of the grid points seen at the top right of the first image. This was partly another restriction on myself, but also just me being pretty much completely unable to think of and draw complex shapes and curves. It made it easier coming up with these random combinations of straight lines which I can do okay.

### Important notes

1. The letter assignments seen in the second image were picked completely randomly. This was just to have a starting point for spelling things out as a proof of concept for the look of the script. I AGAIN don't have much thought or extra development in the characters and where they'd go in a proper script. This is very much a first draft.
2. Letters **Q**, **J**, **V**, **X** and **Z** are obviously excluded here. This was honestly because I stopped drawing after a bit when I hit the wall and I noticed I only had 21 done when I went to assign the temporary letters :) Who needs em' anyway.
3. The '**GYEA**' letters at the top of the first image were arranged there before the second half of the characters were drawn, it's not the name of the script or anything. But maybe it could be, idk.
4. Lastly, the roman numerals in the first photo mean nothing, they're just grouping sort of similar characters. I don't know why I chose roman numerals, it was very very late at night.
