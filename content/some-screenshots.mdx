1. iOS loading screen gets a new wireframe background, and the Tesla logo is removed (unfortunately).
2. All of the different icons for the product categories are now the folder icon, like on macOS (unfortunately again, sort of).

1. The macOS client now uses the OS accent color for certain elements.
2. Dark mode is no longer black like on iOS. This is to allow for window tinting and to more resemble native windows.
3. Some minor changes as well like icon positions and sizes. Visually it's pretty much there, all of the product data just needs to be filled out for both iOS and macOS.

Just went back into Figma and dug this up. Seems like the start of something to do with the **P\*2** UI... maybe another day.
