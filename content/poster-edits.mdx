### Robert Eggers, already a legend

I've been **REALLY** into movie posters in different languages lately, and I wanted to try my hand at editing some of my favorite films posters with my, and some others, custom scripts. **The Witch**, **The Lighthouse** and **The Northman** all really seemed to aesthetically fit for this new script I'm trying to refine. Which still has the VERY temporary and meaningless name, "**GYEA**". I should also mention some of the letter assignments have changed from my [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/13wk0t6/is_this_anything/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), just for anyone to tries to read it.

I DO NOT take credit for the art in this poster, even though it's incredibly cool and I wish I could. I only replaced the names and title with the temporary 1:1 english equivalents in my script. I still have not attempted to make this script into a font, which is why the text looks pretty rough.

The original poster I got from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/639933-the-northman/images/posters?language=en-US). (This is a great place to get tons of different poster designs to play with)

**NOTE**: Always upscale **BEFORE** editing! Applying filters and edits to an image then giving it to the upscaler ruins it. It becomes noisy and more pixelated than it should be. Give the upscaler the cleanest orignal image possible to maintain a smooth ouput, then apply the edits with the end result.
