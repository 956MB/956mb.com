### Mapbox!

Thought I'd start with my favorite feature (future) first! Organizing and watching clips as originally intented was fine, but I evetually got the idea to have a an interactable map to display events in **TX4** from Tesla's internal fleet software. Frankly most of the design influences for this new project come from that fleet software. Thinking about how I could possibly replicate the clean maps Tesla uses, the miracle showed itself. The tiny little **Mapbox** logo in the bottom left of their software.

### Few note-worthly things

1. The \"**inspector**\" or just \"**sidebar**\" I think is going to be extremely useful and well put together. I don't even know how or if I was going to use that info in the Qt version.
2. The floating settings modal. Very minimal, very clean, doesn't take up an entire screen unnecessarily. The app is probably going to be very simple functionality wise, so I don't think it needs more than this.
3. The very different way of laying out sentry or dashcam events on the main screen. I'm hoping to have multiple different layouts for showing clips and their whole events. This design so far is a little big, but I think it's a good start.

### "Influences"

One of the great things about following the Tesla design style and using its themes, is that the layout of the viewer for example is already there for me to \"take from\" the in car software. And it's not copying... Also many other things like fonts, button styles and placements, and the viewer controls and layouts.

Using all of these various elements of Tesla's style, but still tring to shape things in a unique way and add new functionality is really going to contribute to it feeling like a real piece of Tesla software. At least that's the goal.

This splash screenshot makes less than zero sense right now, I just needed a fourth one to have the 2x2 screenshot :)

Working on it!
