### Context

Just messing around with various styles that came to mind with this script. ('Serifthingies', lines instead of circles, and different alignment). I want to point out I STILLfeel like I have no idea what I'm doing! :)

1. This is my first attempt at creating a script and tracing it in Illustrator, which is why it's such a simple and uniform thing I think.
2. Pretty clear looking at the first and second image, theres no grammatical structure or meaning to any of the characters and what their "diacritics" mean. I just start drawing whatever comes to mind. I guess I need to learn more to give substance to the script.
3. The third image is how it originally was. I thought it'd make sense for it to be lined up in that normal way, not by the circles taking up tons of top and bottom space, or maybe it could work in vertical blocks. I think the way it ended up in Illustrator is best for it.
