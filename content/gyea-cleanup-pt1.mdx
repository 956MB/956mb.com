### Missing: J, Q, W, Z

**STILL have zero Illustrator skills, so just rectangles and arcs...**

Two things are clear, my Illustrator skills are still extremely lacking, and I'm too lazy to draw complete alphabets. The missing **J**, **Q**, **W**, and **Z** is partly due to me shuffling around the letters and changing designs on the fly, but I'll get to them eventually. I think this script has potential, but It needs to take a big step forward to look more cohesive and professional.

Below are the \"initial\" cleanups and modifications I've made to the script since the original drawings. I'm still wondering if I can employ my \"rotation hack\" though to mix things up.
