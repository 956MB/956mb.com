A new script here, even though it just looks like a combination of my ["fish hook script"](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/12ia74d/continuationvariation_on_my_fish_hook_script/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and my ["GYEA" thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/13wk0t6/is_this_anything/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)... I guess I can literally only do these kinds of lines and circles :/

I have to give credit to [DaCrazyWorldbuilder](https://www.reddit.com/user/DaCrazyWorldbuilder/) for the crazy good structure of his 'Cbanian O' script, which I used as an initial mapping of the characters in this script because of my complete inability to provide meaning to any of the scripts I draw :) This was just to experiment and try to more easily form words, but I may keep it like this since I think it works so well.

### Different styles going on:

As usual I have no strict direction I want this script to go in, and my patented "rotate stuff until it looks cool" method is at work here. So the script in its current state has three different "modes" if you will:

1. The original layout and how I first drew every character, as seen in the first/third image.
2. The "I love connected horizontal languages so lets rotate it" mode, as seen in the fourth image.
3. And the "rotate it back again and connect the lines" one, also seen in the fourth image.

The second and third "mode" however use the structure from the ['Cbanian O'](https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/comments/16jm43v/cbanian_o/) script with their different levels to the individual characters based on A E I O U usage. I think this approach to the last two styles looks the most unique and adds a lot of variation to things when words are strung together. Also, as seen in the fourth image, I'm not sure connecting the lines at the top and bottom is what I should do with the vertical style. They start to look a little too much like musical notes when I do that (which I want to point out was not in my head at all while drawing!). I always seem to unintentionally draw styles super similar to existing things...
