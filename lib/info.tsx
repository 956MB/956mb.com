I also feel a great urge to share them with others since I think they're so cool, and most things arent natively in 5K (yet). Hopefully this section comes across an a \"public repo\" of sorts for cool wallpapers and things like custom app icons, and not me trying to claim these as my own works. Enjoy.",

export const about_p = `My name is <span class='large-highlight'>${name}</span>, and I’m a self-taught programmer, graphic designer and r/neography hobbyist from <span class='large-highlight'> Dallas, TX </span>.`;

export const bio_p = `My main focus is in frontend design and functionality for desktop and mobile software. I typically start by prototyping in <span class='large-highlight'>Figma </span> and then bring functionality to my designs with code. I’ve created applications for <span class='large-highlight'>Windows</span>, <span class='large-highlight'>macOS</span>, <span class='large-highlight'>iPhone </span>, and <span class='large-highlight'>Apple Watch</span>. When I'm not working on code projects or new designs, I'm slowly learning languages like <span class='large-highlight'>Korean</span> or <span class='large-highlight'>Finnish</span>, and I'm thinking up and drawing new fictional language scripts on <span class='large-highlight'>r/neography</span>.`;

export const background_h = `Background:`;

export const background_p = `I started my self-taught skills journey around 2010, initially focusing on graphic design and mastering <span class='large-highlight'>Photoshop</span>. In 2018, a computer engineer friend introduced me to programming, and it quickly became my passion. After some exploration, I think I \"settled into the design side\" of programming, combining my still expanding coding skills with a keen eye for aesthetics.`;

export const languages_h = `Skills:`;

export const languages_p = `In addition to loving <span class='large-highlight'>Swift</span> (and of course <span class='large-highlight'>SwiftUI</span>) for Apple products, I've worked a lot with both <span class='large-highlight'>JavaScript</span> and <span class='large-highlight'>TypeScript</span> to make universal dekstop apps and websites in <span class='large-highlight'>React</span> (<span class='large-highlight'>this website is React!</span>), and I've explored the frontend framework <span class='large-highlight'>Qt</span> with <span class='large-highlight'>C++</span> to some degree. When I'm not using the tried and true <span class='large-highlight'>Electron</span> for the desktop, I'm trying to get the brand new framework <span class='large-highlight'>Tauri</span> to work for me and really master the <span class='large-highlight'>Rust</span> language. Aside from these languages and libraries for creating frontends, my main scripting language of choice is <span class='large-highlight'>Python</span>. Which I've used for tons of little things, including coding challenges like <span class='large-highlight'>Codewars</span> and <span class='large-highlight'>AdventOfCode</span>.`;

export const tools_h = `Tools:`;

export const tools_p = `For all my projects, I rely on <span class='large-highlight'>Figma </span> as my go-to tool for prototyping designs before transitioning to code. I also have years of experience with <span class='large-highlight'>Photoshop</span> and <span class='large-highlight'>Illustrator</span> as well. Additionally, I have some very minor familiarity with programs like <span class='large-highlight'>FontLab</span> and <span class='large-highlight'>FontForge</span>, which I enjoy using for personal hobbies like creating constructed scripts.`;
