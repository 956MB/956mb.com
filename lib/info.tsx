I also feel a great urge to share them with others since I think they're so cool, and most things arent natively in 5K (yet). Hopefully this section comes across as a \"public repo\" of sorts for cool wallpapers and stuff, and not me trying to claim these as my own works (obviously except for the ones I actually did make myself). Enjoy.",

export const bio_p = `My main focus is in frontend design and functionality for desktop and mobile software. I typically start by prototyping in <span class='large-highlight'>Figma </span> and then bring functionality to my designs with code. I’ve created applications for <span class='large-highlight'>Windows</span>, <span class='large-highlight'>macOS</span>, <span class='large-highlight'>iPhone </span>, and <span class='large-highlight'>Apple Watch</span>. When I'm not working on code projects or new designs, I'm slowly learning languages like <span class='large-highlight'>Korean</span> or <span class='large-highlight'>Finnish</span>, and I'm thinking up and drawing new fictional language scripts on <span class='large-highlight'>r/neography</span>.`;

export const background_h = `BACKGROUND:`;

export const background_p = `I started my self-taught skills journey around 2010, initially focusing on graphic design and mastering <span class='large-highlight p-photoshop'>Photoshop</span>. In 2018, a computer engineer friend introduced me to programming, and it quickly became my passion. After some exploration, I think I \"settled into the design side\" of programming, combining my still expanding coding skills with a keen eye for aesthetics.`;

export const languages_h = `SKILLS:`;

export const languages_p = `In addition to loving <span class='large-highlight p-swift'>Swift</span> (and of course <span class='large-highlight p-swiftui'>SwiftUI</span>) for Apple products, I've worked a lot with both <span class='large-highlight p-javascript'>JavaScript</span> and <span class='large-highlight p-typescript'>TypeScript</span> to make universal dekstop apps and websites in <span class='large-highlight p-react'>React</span> (<span class='large-highlight'>this website is React!</span>), and I've explored the frontend framework <span class='large-highlight p-qt'>Qt</span> with <span class='large-highlight p-cpp'>C++</span> to some degree. When I'm not using the tried and true <span class='large-highlight p-electron'>Electron</span> for the desktop, I'm trying to get the brand new framework <span class='large-highlight p-tauri'>Tauri</span> to work for me and really master the <span class='large-highlight p-rust'>Rust</span> language. Aside from these languages and libraries for creating frontends, my main scripting language of choice is <span class='large-highlight p-python'>Python</span>. Which I've used for tons of little things, including coding challenges like <span class='large-highlight p-codewars'>Codewars</span> and <span class='large-highlight p-adventofcode'>AdventOfCode</span>.`;

export const tools_h = `TOOLS:`;

export const tools_p = `For all my projects, I rely on <span class='large-highlight p-figma'>Figma </span> as my go-to tool for prototyping designs before transitioning to code. I also have years of experience with <span class='large-highlight p-photoshop'>Photoshop</span> and <span class='large-highlight p-illustrator'>Illustrator</span> as well. Additionally, I have some very minor familiarity with programs like <span class='large-highlight p-fontlab'>FontLab</span>, <span class='large-highlight'>FontForge</span> and <span class='large-highlight p-calligraphr'>Calligraphr</span>, which I enjoy using for personal hobbies like creating constructed scripts.`;

export const neography_d = `I love language, and I'm a visual person so I especially love scripts. Not just real-world, but fictional as well (Lord of The Rings, Star Wars, Dune, etc). A really inspiriing figure to me is <a class="p-link" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dedalvs.com/\">David J. Peterson</a>, creator of the languages for Game of Thrones, and MANY other things. These are most of the language scripts (and eventually conlangs) I've created for the <a class="p-link" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/neography/\">r/neography</a> subreddit, and maybe one day it'll be as impressive a collection as David's.`;
