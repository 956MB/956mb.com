export const about_p = `My name is <span class='highlight'>${name}</span>, and I’m a self-taught programmer, graphic designer and r/neography hobbyist from <span class='highlight'> Dallas, TX </span>.`;

export const bio_p = `My main focus is in frontend design and functionality for desktop and mobile software. I typically start by prototyping in <span class='highlight'>Figma </span> and then bring functionality to my designs with code. I’ve created applications for <span class='highlight'>Windows </span>, <span class='highlight'>macOS</span>, <span class='highlight'>iPhone </span>, and <span class='highlight'>Apple Watch</span>. While I do lean towards Apple platforms, I'm comfortable working on projects using various frameworks and languages that I've come to learn.`;

export const background_h = `Background:`;

export const background_p = `I started my self-taught skills journey around 2010, initially focusing on graphic design and mastering <span class='highlight'>Photoshop</span>. In 2018, a computer engineer friend introduced me to programming, and it quickly became my passion. After some exploration, I think I \"settled into the design side\" of programming, combining my coding skills with a keen eye for aesthetics. My goal is to become a proficient programmer while making sure that the software I create looks good as well.`;

export const languages_h = `Languages & frameworks:`;

export const languages_p = `In addition to <span class='highlight'>Swift</span> (and of course <span class='highlight'>SwiftUI</span>) for Apple applications, I’ve implemented languages like <span class='highlight'>C++</span> using the <span class='highlight'>Qt</span> library, which I absolutely love for desktop software. I've also worked with <span class='highlight'>JavaScript</span>/<span class='highlight'>TypeScript</span> within <span class='highlight'>React</span> applications, utilizing frameworks like <span class='highlight'>Electron</span> and <span class='highlight'>Tauri</span>, <span class='highlight'>C#</span> for some <span class='highlight'>Unity</span> game programming, and obviously <span class='highlight'>Python</span> for general scripting purposes and coding problems. Learning more about <span class='highlight'>Go</span> and getting better at <span class='highlight'>Rust</span> are goals as well.`;

export const tools_h = `Tools:`;

export const tools_p = `For all my projects, I rely on <span class='highlight'>Figma </span> as my go-to tool for prototyping designs before transitioning to code. I also have years of experience with <span class='highlight'>Photoshop</span> and <span class='highlight'>Illustrator</span> as well. Additionally, I have some very minor familiarity with programs like <span class='highlight'>FontLab</span> and <span class='highlight'>FontForge</span>, which I enjoy using for personal hobbies like creating constructed scripts.`;
